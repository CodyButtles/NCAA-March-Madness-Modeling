# NCAA-March-Madness-Modeling

## Background

Sports, especially basketball, are a passion of mine and thousands of people get excited every year for March Madness. I am no exception and I strive to create the best bracket along with everyone else. In the fall of 2019 the idea of using data analysis and modeling to try and predict the winners of March Madness games was given to me at The Great Lakes Analytics Conference held in Stevens Point, WI. I was gracially given a dataset for past March Madness tournaments and worked to create a model using XGBoost to try and predict future games.
